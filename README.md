# Overview
This project is an implementation of kalman filter algorithm as part of Navigation Algorithms course.
The algorithm is used in the context of localization and tracking a moving object in a 2D space dimension.
The simulation (of the algorithm) shows how a combination of dynamic prediction of future states (based on current state) and sensor's 
measurements can be used together to trace a system which moves in a linearic manner.
